## Mjolnir Configuration

[Mjolnir](https://github.com/mjolnir-io/mjolnir) is a lightweight automation and 
productivity app for OS X. It's the spiritual successor of Hydra, my previous 
window manager. 

These files are currently in their *very* early stages and aren't quite as 
"complete" as my Hydra config, but they do everything that I really need them to. 
It'll get updated as I find things it needs to do.
